## About

This project uses React, Typescript, Leaflet and OpenStreetMap to show points of interest (POIs). It will automatically set bounds and zoom to the loaded POIs. By default, it will show a few cities of Romania. The format for the POI is:

```typescript
type PointOfInterest = {
  id?: string
  latitude: number
  longitude: number
  title: string
  description?: string | string[]
  images?: string[]
}
```

### Response types

If you specify an address in the `?api=` url param, then it will try to use that as a source for the points. Please remember to have the following format in your response:

```typescript
interface Response extends Array<PointOfInterest> {}
```

There is also an option to use an enveloped structure:

```typescript
interface APIEnvelope {
  metadata: string | string[]
  config: {
    typeOfIcon: 'text' | 'default' | 'dot' // default, the icon to use in the data
    isListEnabled: boolean | undefined // true, show the toggler to view a list
    isListFilteredToViewport: boolean | undefined // false, show only the POIs in the viewport
    isZoomOnSelectEnabled: boolean | undefined // false, zoom to a POI when clicked
    isShowOnlyURLRecordEnabled: boolean | undefined // true, show only the record specified in the url
    isAggressiveOptimizationEnabled: boolean | undefined // false, aggressively limit the number of records shown on the map to improve performance
  }
  records: PointOfInterest[]
}
```

### URL Parameters

- `?api=` - Specifies the API endpoint or JSON file to load POI data from
- `?id=` - Focuses on a specific record by its ID and opens its details panel

**Example URLs:**

- `/?api=/cities_in_romania.json` - Load the demo data
- `/?api=/cities_in_romania.json&id=id_1` - Load demo data and focus on Cluj-Napoca (second record)
- `/?api=https://your-api.com/pois.json&id=custom-poi-123` - Load from API and focus on specific record

**Note:** If your data doesn't include `id` fields, the system will automatically generate them using the pattern `id_0`, `id_1`, `id_2`, etc., based on the array index.

## Install and first run

- `npm i`

## Notes
